  <h1>Shell Shockers Map Editor</h1>
  <h3>the official BWD map builder, leaked by StateFarm / 1ust</h3>
</div>

<br>
<h2 align="center">usage</h2>

first, visit [a predeployed version](https://build.pretty.boats) (or if you don't trust me, deploy it yourself).

> [!WARNING]
> It will NOT work the first time you load the page. BWD made bad code. Just reload once to fix.

To start, double click a slot on the hotbar to select an item to put there.<br>
Then, click the map and use W, A, S, and D to move around. You can't use space, just look up and hold W.<br>
To place something in the hotbar, use the number to select the slot and then click a spot on the map.<br>
To remove an item on the map, click it. While pointed at an element, use space to rotate it.

<h2 align="center">faq</h2>

i joined bwd discord server and talked to some people about it, and i got a few questions:

> how'd you get this?

it was public on the staging link under `mapEdit.php`. i just cloned the code.

> is this going to hack me?

see my rants below.

<br>
<h2 align="center">controversy</h2>

so, when I "leaked" this, people got angry. these are my responses to each claim people made

> this editor is FAKE.

it's literally not. the source is here. read it yourself.

> the editor steals your Discord cookie!

yea i don't know what brainless person came up with this, but [here's a cookie rundown for the idiot who did.](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/how-to-enable-cookies/faq/which-websites-can-read-my-cookies#:~:text=A%20cookie%20can%20only%20be%20read%20by%20the%20site%20that%20created%20it&text=Cookies%20are%20extremely%20important%20to,the%20site%20that%20created%20them.)

> the editor steals skins

:skull: please stop coming up with this shit. our version is not hosted on shellshock.io so it can't see cookies. see above link.

if you have any questions about the map editor, dm **@1ust.js**. unless you think adding me as a discord friend will hack you. in which case, just go die.<br>
life tip before you dm: get rid of the mindset that everything statefarm makes is complete garbage and wants to hack you.<br>
